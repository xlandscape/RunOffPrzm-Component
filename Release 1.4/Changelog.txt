Version 1.01
Application rates in PPM-Calendar are now expexted in [g/ha] instead of [kg/ha]
In the output grids, exposure in [g/ha] are given instead of [mg/cell]

Version 1.02
Negative exposure values on the treated field eliminated

Version 1.03
Reporting threashold for runoff exposure may now be changed in Configuration.xml in the section parameters/options/reporting_threashold
DT50 values are now takes as DT50 [d] and not as rates [1/d]
SoilDT50 was not used as described in the XML file in the previous version but only a default value.

Version 1.04
FieldsGrid and FlowGrid are compared after reading. If they do not match, an error is thrown.
Temporary Grids are now also compressed using DFLATE.
Grids at days without Runoff are not written any more.
When the RunOff Module finished sucessfully, a file "successful.txt" ist written into the output folder.
The temporary output path gets an subfolder named by the ProcessID of the current process. Please note: If the path where PRZM runs is more than 45 characters (inclusive "\"), PRZM crashes.

Version 1.05
KD is now used correctly.

Version 1.06
Application dates are sorted before written to PRZM inp file.
Temporary PRZM Folder is used without the ProcessID again.

Version 1.1
The module has been splitted into two executibles. PRZM_Runoff.exe calculates the generation of Runoff using PRZM for every field. HydroFilter_Runoff.exe distributes the runoff in the landscape and hence calculates exposure.

Version 1.2
Runoff can also be calculated according to Step2. Therefore new nodes are available in RunOff_Configuration.xml.

Version 1.21
Some Bug fixes

Version 1.22
Some Bug fixes

version 1.24
some Bug fixes

version 1.25
Delete unused output grids

version 1.26
Fixed the bug that erosion and water runoff is inverted
Changed the reporting threashold for consistent results

version 1.3
Integrated an Application pattern to each application event to simulate spray buffers
Excluded the merging of all field results to one landscape grid per day.

version 1.31
runoff grid is now compressed (as all other grid are)
Using the flat <delete_all_interim_results> in the main xml file it can be decided that all files in the output folder (except *.tif-files) are deleted as soon as they are not necessary any more.


version 1.32
Bugfix that some applications were not used by the landscape model.

version 1.33
Field grid and Flow grid are now correctly aligned.
Exposure on the field is now completely avoided.

version 1.4
VFS_mod lookup tables are supported
New implementation of a reduced version of PRZM in the hydrofilter runoff module

version 1.41
Bugfixes memory allocation

version 1.42
More output for debugging

version 1.43
Bugfixes memory and runoff flux
Speed improvements

version 1.44
An error which caused very small exposure values (<10E-40) for cells which should have zero exposure
Minor bug fixes

version 1.45
An error which caused an crash of the programm when VFSMod lookup tables were used was fixed.
